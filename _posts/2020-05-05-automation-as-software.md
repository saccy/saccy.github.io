The term *automation* is going through its ephemeral, albeit extended, buzzword phase. The truth is that all computer code provides some level of automation and always has done. I suppose when we say automation today in the context of software we're talking about things like DevOps, pipelines, config management and API integrations. Automation code within that context is software that often lacks the attention to detail that traditional application development recieves.

When we think about why automation is on trend and what it can do for business, we're thinking about reducing time and effort and increasing profitability. From my experience, is this thought of effort reduction then associated with the *act* of, for example, developing a pipeline to build, test, and deploy both your infrastructure and application code? Yes. Ironically, automation code is oftentimes hardcoded, untested and duplicated throughout repos. A *'Do as I say, not as I do'* situation.



talk about:
- unpopular opinion: A lot of automation scripting is done by sysadmins with no background in development. We all know those shy guy dinosaurs that infest the deepest recesses of global corporations that identify as sysadmins. 
- error handling
- user interfaces

- Config mgmt: Declarative coding is by nature an abstracted form of coding. This is totally fine and immensely useful, and infact I wouldn't have the career I have without it. 

- documentation
- often rushed
