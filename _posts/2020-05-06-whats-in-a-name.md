- [ ] Whats in a name? Pipeline names - hold a lot of information - metadata for your pipeline - should be code friendly i.e. no whitespace, no case, follow a convention, can make scripts dynamic and reduce repo clutter, avoid randomisation for the sake of randomisation - what about dynamic names? Give an ID
    - [ ] What if I want to use my code outside a pipeline? Consider writing in some cmd line flags so that you can input the vars you need instead of hardcoding pipeline env vars within your script
    - [ ] The same principle can be applied to any new naming convention youâ€™re working on
